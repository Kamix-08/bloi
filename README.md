# bloi

**blOI** (_bardzo łatwa Olimpiada Informatyczna_, or _very easy Informatics Olympiad_) is a mock informatics olympiad, organized by [Paweł](https://github.com/pawello09) and Samuel for our class.

blOI consists of three days, with the practice day having 2 problems and the remaining days having 3 problems each.

Each day's problems are located in the `/problems/` subdirectory _(in Polish)_.

All of the final solutions were graded `100/100`.
